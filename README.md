# react-create-app
A full react app with babel 7 and webpack 4

This is a better way of creating a react project from scratch then using Facebook's react-create-app. Facebook's react-create-app hides
too much functionaliy like webpack and store settings. You will learn react more if you clone this project and take the time to realy learn 
how react / redux are set up. Please ping me at StevenWickers@gmail.com if you find this app usefull.
